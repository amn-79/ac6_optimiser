# AC6 Optimiser
If you just want the download, it's the .exe in the build folder. If you want to make sure this doesn't install a bitcoin miner, look at the python files (though I have 0 CS background, so they might make your eyes bleed).

Mostly feature complete if a bit slow if few restrictions are placed on it. Planning to add:
- Constraint on boost speed (mostly understand how the game works, just not sure how to implement it into the program)
- Would like to add assault boost speed, but not sure about the formula (Need to check regulations)
- Drop-down selection menu generators (Normal/Coral) perhaps, similar to leg types
- Some of the displayed stats are not rounded bc I couldn't be bothered
- Ultimately, I want this to be a web app so people don't have to download strange .exes. I'd have to learn Flask (probably?) and HTML for that though, so it'll take time

If you have additional feature suggestions/find issues or bugs, please let me know.
